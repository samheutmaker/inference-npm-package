Hi @bryiac! I couldn't find another way to reach you. It looks like you might be the owner the the @inference NPM organization [here](https://www.npmjs.com/org/inference). 

I'm interesting in buying this org from you for a few thousand dollars. I know this migh seem weird, but I assure you this is a serious offer.

If you're interested, please shoot me an email at sam at inference.net.

Thanks!

Sam Heutmaker
